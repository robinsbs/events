ToDo

Create ViewModel tests
Remove ViewModel dependency on Events.Autofac project
Change IRegistration interfaces to be inputs to the container setup
Default registration to "new" and make "singleton" the exception like autofac does
change IEventStream to accept args as input to Publish method
implement IRegister
change Subscriber logic to use events to respond to the delay changes
change event stream logic to allow wait cursor notification when events are being processed and have not finished yet
remove as much 'public' surface area as possible
try to allow multiple event streams to coexist
try to allow one event stream to forward events to another event stream
Unsubscribe() should flip a bit... not remove from the dictionary... that way Resubscribe() could also be implemented
A Subscriber must be able to subscribe to multiple events
Support execution ordering of event subscribers
Support injecting event subscriber execution precondition/postcondition/valdations/etc.
ISubscribeToBefore<>
ISubscribeToAfter<>
Publish<>()
Support Publish cancellation
Support ISubscriptions<> injection for subscription management
Support Publish progress indicator

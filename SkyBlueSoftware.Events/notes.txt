Composable Event Stream

var events = EventStream.Create<TEventBase>();
var subscriberA = new SubscriberA();
var subscriberB = new SubscriberB();
var subscriptionA = events.Subscribe<TEventA>(subscriberA);
var subscriptionB = events.Subscribe<TEventB>(subscriberB);

Multiple event streams that can communicate back and forth by forwarding events
ISubscribeTo<T>
ISubscribeConfigurableTo<T> : ISubscribeTo<T> // allows subscriber to configure the subscription at startup and pause/restart events etc.

ISubscribeTo<TEventStream, TEvent>

ToDo

create extension methods that get the event type(s) from an instance
create extension methods that get the event type(s) from a type
try to allow multiple event streams to coexist
try to allow one event stream to forward events to another event stream
Unsubscribe() should flip a bit... not remove from the dictionary... that way Resubscribe() could also be implemented
A Subscriber must be able to subscribe to multiple events
Support execution ordering of event subscribers
Support injecting event subscriber execution precondition/postcondition/valdations/etc.
